impalascripts-0.6
=================

Scripts used to execute and time queries for Impala beta 0.6 Demo VM.

Some of these came with the Cloudera Impala demo VM and some I added.

These scripts, specifically the query A-H ones, go with a presentation on Impala that I gave. You can find the slides here: http://www.slideshare.net/scottleber/impala-19176906
